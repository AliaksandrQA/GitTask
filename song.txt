Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield

What if I wanted to break
Laugh it all off in your face
What would you do?
What if I fell to the floor
Couldn't take all this anymore
What would you do, do, do?

Come, break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you
